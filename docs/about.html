        <p>As of writing this, I am a third year student at Penn State Behrend. This website is to showcase my work in my Digit 110 class, Digital Humanities.    
        </p>
        <p>I am 20 years old and my hometown is <a id="mercer" href="https://mercerborough.com/">Mercer, PA</a> </p>
        <p>I have two Golden Retreviers. One is aalmost 3 years old, his name is Tucker. The other is almost 2 years old, his name is Beauregaurd.</p>

            I love to hike, camp, hunt, skate, snoowboard, and occasionally indulge in some video games!
        </p>
        <p>In Digit 110, I have done some XML, Schema writing, TEI, and a Semester project with a team.</p>
        <p>Enjoy looking at the work I have done throughout the semester.</p>
